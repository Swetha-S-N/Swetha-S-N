Hi The procastinator kid here!

I am currently working as System analyst in a start up company

Starting of my journey I wanted to become a doctor but the fate bought me to engineering.I was fascinated at first when I joined engineering but some what enjoyed my college life also.
I was getting serious about my studies then the COVID came!.That's where I jumped into full time enjoyment and least cared about my placements and all.Some what I got distracted from my studies
as i was staying in my native.That is the mistake I did.No I realised it.I got a job in tech where I felt something not good for me.I took a decision to quit the job in one year.Going against my
family members took that decision.Now I am currently here trying to learn a proper web development from the beginning.

My Journey Begins....
